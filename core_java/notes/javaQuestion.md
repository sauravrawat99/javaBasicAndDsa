What is Java? Why is Java platform-independent?
--
Java is object-oriented,platform independent programming language use to develop scalable application

why java platform independent
-java platform independent because 
*java code compile in bytecode, Not machine code 
*This bytecode run on jvm (java virtual machine)
*Each os has on jvm  

mmi==Java is platform-independent because compiled bytecode runs on JVM, not directly on the operating system.

Difference between JDK, JRE, and JVM?
-

| Term    | Full Form                | Purpose                                   |
| ------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| **JVM** | Java Virtual Machine     | Executes Java bytecode                    |
| **JRE** | Java Runtime Environment | Provides environment to run Java programs |
| **JDK** | Java Development Kit     | Used to develop and run Java programs     |

jvm-(java virtual machine)
* convert bytecode to machine code 
* platform independent
responsive for:=>1.memory management 2.garbage collection 3.execution of program

jreJRE (Java Runtime Environment)

Contains:
JVM
Core Java libraries
Used only to run Java applications
Cannot compile Java code
👉 JRE = JVM + Libraries

JDK (Java Development Kit)
Used to develop Java programs
Contains:
JRE
Compiler (javac)
Debugger and tools
👉 JDK = JRE + Development tools

mmi=>JVM runs the program, JRE provides runtime environment, and JDK is used to develop Java applications.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is bytecode in Java?
-
bytecode in java intermediate code generator by the java compiler after compile a.java file 
java source code compile ==javac
output .class file called bytecode

mmi==> bytecode is the intermediate flatform independent in java compiler which is code execution
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Why Java is not 100% object-oriented?
-
java in pure oop programing language but they support primitive datatype
like int float boolean dabble char

and that primitive datatype store daringly
and they do not belong any class and do not have any methods 

mmi=> Java is not 100% object-oriented because it supports primitive data types that are not objects.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Difference between == and .equals()?
-
| `==`                                | `.equals()`                 |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Compares **memory reference**       | Compares **content/value**  |
| Used for reference comparison       | Used for logical comparison |
| Works same for objects & primitives | Mainly used for objects     |
| Cannot be overridden                | Can be overridden           |

mmi=> == compares memory references, while .equals() compares actual object content.

What is Class and Object?
-
Class=>The class is the blue print or template used to create object,
its define data (variable) behavior(methods)

object=> An object is a real-world instance of a class.
It represents actual data and uses the class methods.

mmi=> A class is a blueprint, and an object is an instance created from that class.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Types of variables in Java?
-
Local => 1,Declare inside the method or block 2.used only within method 3.no default value
example=> void show() {
            int x = 10;
            }


Instance=> 1.Declare inside the class but outside method 2,belong to a object 3, gets default value
example  class Test {
int a;   // instance variable
}

Static=>1Declared using static keyword
2,Shared among all objects
3,Memory allocated once

class Test {
static int count = 0;
}

mmi Java has three types of variables: local, instance, and static variables.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is static keyword?
-
the static keyword use for variable and methods or block belong to class instant of the object

1.Static members are shared among all objects
2.memory allocate only once 
3.can be access using class name 

example
class Test {
static int x = 10;
}

access= text.x //10

The static keyword is used to create class-level members that are shared by all objects.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Why main() method is static?
-
the main method is static because jvm need to without creating an object

1. program executions start main()
2. At this time no object exits
3. f main() were not static, JVM would need an object first 
4. That would create a dependency problem
5. 
So, main() is made static to allow direct access by JVM using class name.

mmi=> The main method is static so that JVM can call it without creating an object.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Can we overload main() method?
-
yes we can overload main methods in java
1. java allowed same method difference parameter 
2. we can create multiple main method 
3. but jvm tun only Public static void main(String[] args)
4. and other main method do not run automatically

mmi =Yes, main() can be overloaded, but JVM always calls only public static void main(String[] args).
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What happens if we don’t write main() method?
-
If we don’t write the main() method, the program will compile successfully but will not run.
At runtime, JVM throws this error:
Error: Main method not found in class

JVM starts execution from main() method
Without main(), JVM doesn’t know where to begin execution

mmi=Without the main() method, the program compiles but fails at runtime because JVM cannot find the entry point.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is wrapper class?
-
A Wrapper Class in Java is used to convert primitive data types into objects.
int → Integer
double → Double
char → Character

Why wrapper classes are needed?
Collections (like ArrayList) store only objects
To use primitives as objects

mmi=Wrapper classes convert primitive data types into objects so they can be used where objects are required.
