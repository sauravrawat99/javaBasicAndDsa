** What is java
* === java is object-oriented,platform-independent programming language,
* java code compile in bytecode and this bytecode run of jvm(java virtual machine).
* that's why java follow run once run anywhere

** why java is independent
* java don't run directly on os
* first in convert bytecode and jvm run that bytecode
* since jvm available every os

**JDK vs JRE vs JVM
*jvm 
- execute bytecode
- and jvm manage memory and garbage collections

*jre
-jvm require library
-use to java program

*jdk
- jre+compiler+developmentTools
- Used to develop java program

**Why Java is not 100% object-oriented?
Because Java supports primitive data types like int, char, boolean.
These are not objects, so Java is not fully object-oriented.

what is class and object
class == the class is  A blueprint of object  -- and do not occupy memory
object== the object is a instance of class --occuoy memory it runtime
