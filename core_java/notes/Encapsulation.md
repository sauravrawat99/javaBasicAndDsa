Encapsulation:
Encapsulation means wrapping data (variables) and methods (functions) into a single
unit (class) and controlling access to that data.

How to achieve?
1. Make variables private
2. Provide public getter & setter

Why Encapsulation?
- Security
- Controlled access
- Code maintainable
- Prevents misuse of data

Example:
private int age;
public void setAge(int age)
public int getAge()

Real Life Example:
ATM Machine
- User can't access balance directly
- Uses methods (withdraw, deposit)

Advantages:
- Data protection
- Flexibility to change logic
- Better control

Interview Line:
Encapsulation is achieved by using private variables and public getter-setter methods.
