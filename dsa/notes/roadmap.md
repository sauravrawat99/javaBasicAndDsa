Here is a realistic, up-to-date DSA Roadmap with Java (as of 2026) that works very well for:

Campus placements
Off-campus product-based companies (Amazon, Google, Atlassian, Uber, etc.)
Competitive programming improvement
Getting strong problem-solving skills

Expected timeline (serious daily effort 4–7 hours/day):

Beginner (zero DSA) → decent level: 4–7 months
Intermediate → interview-ready (300–450 quality problems): 7–12 months

Phase 0: Java Prerequisites (1–4 weeks)
You must be comfortable writing Java code quickly before serious DSA.
Must-know topics:

Variables, Data types, Operators
Loops, conditionals, switch
Methods, parameters, return
Classes, Objects, constructors
Access modifiers, static, final
Arrays (1D + 2D), Strings, StringBuilder
ArrayList, HashMap, HashSet (basic usage)
Exception handling (try-catch)
Basic Input/Output (Scanner / BufferedReader)
Java 8+ → Lambdas, Streams (optional but helpful later)

Resources:

Kunal Kushwaha Java playlist (YouTube) or
"Java – The Complete Reference" (first 10–12 chapters) or
Coding Ninjas / Apna College Java course

Phase 1: Foundation & Warm-up (3–6 weeks)
Goal: Build intuition + master complexity analysis
Order → Topic → Approx. problems

Time & Space Complexity + Big-O
→ Must deeply understand (very frequently asked)
Arrays (very important)
→ 35–55 problems
Hashing / HashMap / HashSet
→ 25–40 problems
Strings (very important in interviews)
→ 20–35 problems
Searching & Sorting (implement + understand)
→ Binary Search (must master variations)
→ QuickSort / MergeSort (implement once)

Good starting sheets:

Love Babbar 450 → Arrays + Hashing + Strings section
Striver A2Z sheet → Step 1–4
takeuforward.org → Java code available

Phase 2: Linear & Classic Data Structures (6–10 weeks)
Order → Topic → Approx. problems (quality)

Linked List (Singly + Doubly + Circular) → 25–40
Stack & Queue (including Deque) → 20–35
Two Pointers → 15–25
Sliding Window → 15–25
Fast & Slow Pointers / Floyd Cycle → 8–15
Binary Search on Answer → 12–20
Prefix Sum / Cumulative Sum → 10–20
Kadane’s Algorithm & variants → 8–15

Patterns > memorizing questions
Phase 3: Non-Linear Data Structures (8–14 weeks)

Binary Tree traversals (recursive + iterative) → 20–30
Binary Search Tree (BST) → 15–25
Heaps / PriorityQueue → 20–35
Graphs (BFS + DFS) → 30–50
Adjacency List in Java
Connected components, cycle detection

Binary Tree Medium/Hard (LCA, diameter, etc.) → 25–40

Phase 4: Advanced & Pattern-based Topics (8–16 weeks)
Focus on these only after being comfortable with Phase 1–3.
Order of importance in 2026 interviews:

Greedy → 20–35
Backtracking → 20–40 (N-Queens, subsets, combinations)
Dynamic Programming (most important advanced topic)
1D DP → 25–40
2D DP → 30–50
DP on Strings → 15–25
DP on Trees → 10–20
DP + Bitmasking (optional but high value)

Tries → 10–20
Segment Tree / Fenwick Tree (BIT) → 8–15 (only if targeting top-tier companies)
Graph Advanced
Dijkstra
Topological Sort
MST (Kruskal / Prim)
Strongly Connected Components (optional)



Recommended Practice Platforms (Java-friendly in 2026)
Priority order:

Priority,Platform,Best for,Problems to aim
1,LeetCode,Interview preparation,350–500
2,GeeksforGeeks,Topic-wise Java solutions,—
3,Codeforces,Speed + implementation,Div 3 + Div 2
4,AtCoder,Clean math + DP problems,Beginner–Regular
5,HackerRank,Warm-up + certifications,—


opular lists/sheets in 2026:

Striver’s SDE Sheet / A2Z DSA Sheet
Love Babbar 450
takeuforward A2Z
NeetCode 150 / Blind 75 (good starting point)
Fraz sheet / Tech Dose sheet

Suggested 6–8 Month Plan (Aggressive)
Month 1–2 → Phase 1 + start Phase 2
Month 3–4 → Finish Phase 2 + start Trees
Month 5–6 → Graphs + Heaps + Greedy
Month 7–8 → DP (heaviest investment) + Revision + Mock interviews
