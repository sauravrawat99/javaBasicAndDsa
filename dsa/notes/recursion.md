** what is recursion
====> The recursions is technique where functions solve a problem
by calling its self on a smaller input utils  base on conditions on met 

** why base case is important
=======> The base case is very important in recursion because it determines
the stoping conditions for the recursive function

** what is stack overflow
======>The stack overflow is a classic programming error 

it happens when a program uses to much space on the call stack(usually because of infinite recursion 
deep functions call




Ek kaam ko chhote same kaam me tod dena

what time to use recursion
Jab problem:
✔ chhoti same problem me break ho sake
✔ repeat ho rahi ho

Factorial

Fibonacci

Array traversal

Binary Search

Tree / Graph


most important in recursion
1 base case => jab condition false ho jaye 
2 recursion call = its self calling

stack problem
Har recursive call stack me store hoti hai

Recursion memory zyada use karti hai


flow of working
Function call hota hai
↓
Kaam karta hai
↓
Khud ko call karta hai
↓
Base case milta hai
↓
Return hota hai


recu vs loop
| Point       | Recursion  | Loop         |
| ----------- | ---------- | ------------ |
| Readability | Easy       | Medium       |
| Memory      | Zyada      | Kam          |
| Speed       | Thoda slow | Fast         |
| Use         | DSA        | Normal logic |



Interview One-Liners

Recursion is a function calling itself.
Every recursion must have a base case.
Recursion uses stack memory.
