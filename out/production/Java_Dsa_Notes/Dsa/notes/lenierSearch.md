Linear Search:
- Simple searching technique
- Checks elements one by one
- Starts from index 0

When to use?
- Small array
- Unsorted array

Algorithm:
1. Start from first element
2. Compare with target
3. If match → return index
4. If end reached → return -1

Time Complexity:
Best Case → O(1)
Worst Case → O(n)
Average → O(n)

Space Complexity:
O(1)

Advantages:
- Easy to implement
- Works on unsorted array

Disadvantages:
- Slow for large data
